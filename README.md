# Manning's Flow Calculator

A web-based calculator for hydraulic flow calculations using Manning's equation. This tool helps engineers and hydrologists analyze flow in circular pipes, box culverts, and trapezoidal channels.

## Features

- **Circular Pipe Flow Calculator**: Calculate flow rate, velocity, and normal depth for partial or full pipe flow
- **Box Culvert Flow Calculator**: Analyze rectangular culvert hydraulics
- **Trapezoidal Channel Calculator**: Evaluate open channel flow characteristics
- **Size Determination**: Find the minimum required pipe or culvert size for a given design flow
- **Interactive Visualizations**: View rating curves for depth vs. flow and depth vs. velocity
- **Multiple Material Options**: Select from various materials with predefined roughness coefficients
- **Mobile-Friendly Design**: Responsive layout works on desktop and mobile devices

## Technical Details

### Manning's Equation

The calculator uses Manning's equation to determine flow characteristics:

V = (1.49/n) * R<sub>h</sub><sup>2/3</sup> * S<sup>1/2</sup>

Where:
- V is the cross-sectional average velocity (ft/s)
- n is Manning's roughness coefficient
- R<sub>h</sub> is the hydraulic radius (ft)
- S is the slope of the hydraulic grade line (ft/ft)

Flow rate is calculated as:

Q = V * A

Where:
- Q is the flow rate (cfs)
- A is the cross-sectional area of flow (ftÂ²)
